# Welcome to the stat_front code!

Because they contain secret data, two files aren't versioned in this repository: .env
.env contain notably the backend url

It should NEVER be versioned (it contains secret data)


To run locally the code needs node 18.20.4
If you have more than one node version installed, use nvm like so in the terminal:
1 to check the current version of node and which are available on your computer:
nvm list
2 to choose the correct one 
nvm use 18.20.4

then in the stats_front directory you should run the following commands in the terminal
npm install
npm run dev

The url where the dev demo is running will appear in the terminal
By default it will be: http://localhost:3000/

For backend interaction to work, the variable BACKEND_BASE_URL should point to an active api


The main branch sould only be for production code that is ready to be online
